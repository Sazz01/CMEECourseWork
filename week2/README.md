##Project Title: CMEE Coursework Repository Week 2

##Brief Description: 
#A compilation of code and tasks from week 2 to be assessed as part of our final grade of CMEE Mres at Imperial College London. Instructions for the coding tasks can be found at  https://mhasoba.github.io/TheMulQuaBio/intro.html in chapter 'Biological Computing with Python I'.

#Languages used within the project: 
    bash version 5.0.17(1) 
    Python 3.8.10

#Dependencies used within the project: 
    Visual Studio Code 1.60.2 
    Git 2.25.1

##Installation: 

#How to install dependent software:

#Visual Studio Code: 
   Manually download .deb file from https://code.visualstudio.com/download
   
       cd ../path/to/the file
       install sudo dpkg -i <file>.deb 
       
#Python:
  In the bash terminal type:
       
       python3
       
  You will get a new command prompt that looks like this:
  
        >>>
  Now type:
  
      import this
  
#Git: 
  
       sudo apt-get install git 



##Usage: 

Brief Explanations for each file Within Code directory does:

align_seqs.py - """This script aligns two DNA sequences form an external file such that they are as similar as possible, and saves the best alignment and its corresponding in a text file. This script also functions as a programme"""

boilerplate.py - This script prints 'this is a boiler plate'

lc1.py - This script modifies lists via comprehensions and loops

lc2.py -This script modifies other lists via comprehensions and loops

test_control_flow.py - This script shows functions which exemplify the use of control statements and doctesting

basic_csv.py - This script reads a .csv file into the workspace, and creates a new file 
containing only a subset of the data.

cfexercises2.py - This script demonstrates how conditional functions allows for fine-grained control over the functionâ€™s operations. 

sysargv.py - The script helps us to understand what sys.argv is and how it is used

basic_io2.py - his script demonstrates code that can be used to save and export data in python

basic_io1.py - This script demonstrates code that can be used to import data into python

control_flow.py - This script shows functions which exemplify the use of control statements

loops.py - This script demonstrates some loops and how they work

tuple.py - This script modifies tuples via loops

basic_io3.py - This script demonstrates code that can be used to store data for later use and load it in python

debugme.py - This script is used to demonstrate how debugging works


oaks.py - Finds out taxa that are oak trees from a list of species

using_name.py - This script demonstrates a programme being run by itself is differentiated from  being imported form another module

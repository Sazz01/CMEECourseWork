### Brief Description: 
A compilation of code and tasks from the GIS Week to be assessed ***only *** for neatness of the directory and scripts as part of our final grade of CMEE Mres at Imperial College London. Instructions for the coding tasks can be found at https://davidorme.github.io/Masters_GIS/intro.html.

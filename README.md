Project Title: CMEE Coursework Repository 

Brief Description: A compilation of code and tasks to be assessed as part of our final grade of CMEE Mres at Imperial College London; which requires the following tasks to be completed in either a linux or mac computer. Instructions for the coding tasks can be found at  https://mhasoba.github.io/TheMulQuaBio/intro.html. 


Project Structure:

The project is separated into ten weeks, where each week certain chapters will be completed and submitted to be marked. For more details on tasks completed each week, please see the README.md file for each respective week.

will be given in the week's README.md files.

data: A compilation of files used to run the scripts, taken from https://github.com/mhasoba/TheMulQuaBio

# Project Title: CMEE Coursework Repository 

## Brief Description: 
A compilation of code and tasks to be assessed as part of our final grade of CMEE Mres at Imperial College London; which requires the following tasks to be completed in either a linux or mac computer. Instructions and chapters for the coding tasks can be found at  https://mhasoba.github.io/TheMulQuaBio/intro.html. 


## Project Structure:

The project is separated into 9 directories, certain chapters are completed and submitted to be marked. A list of which chapters were completed in each directory are listed below. For more details on which tasks are completed and language and dependencies are used in each directory please see the README.md file for each respective directory.  


**Week 1**: UNIX and linux, Shell Scripting, Version Control with Git, Scientific Documents with LaTeX

**Week 2**: Biological Computing with Python I 
     
**Week 3**: Data Management and Visualisation, Experimental Design and Data Exploration, 
     
**Week 7**: Biological Computing with Python II, Introduction to Jupyter, Data Analyses with Python and Jupyter

**miniproject**: Model fitting using non-linear least squares. The Computing Miniproject
     
**proposal**: Not applicable. See README.md file for more details

**Feedback**: Not applicable. See README.md file for more details

**Genomics**: Not applicable. See README.md file for more details

**GIS**: Not applicable. See README.md file for more details




## Folders within each directory (excluding Feedback):


**code**: A compilation of files containing code for the tasks assigned for each week. A list of files and a brief description of what these files do will be given in the week's README.md files.

**data**: A compilation of files used to run the scripts, taken from https://github.com/mhasoba/TheMulQuaBio

**results**: an empty file where outputs are moved to when running scripts
    
**sandbox**: place for experimental files

***any unique folders will be explained in their respective directories***

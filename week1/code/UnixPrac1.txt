 #1 make sure your in the right directory first 
 
 cd ../data/fasta
 
 
 #2 counting the number of lines there are in each fasta file using 'wc -l'. 'wc' prints of the number of lines, words and bytes a file has. '-l' species to only print off the number of lines.
 
 wc -l 407228326.fasta; wc -l 407228412.fasta; wc -l E.coli.fasta 

 #3 printing out the sequence length of the E. coli genome by using 'tail -n +2' on the E.coli.fasta file. 'tail' prints off the bottom lines. '-n +2' specifies to print everything to the bottom of the file from the second line of the file. 
 
 tail -n +2 E.coli.fasta 


#4 to calculate the sequence length of the E. coli genome, we first remove the first line as stated above, we then use 'wc-m', which specifically counts the number of characters within the file with the first line removed.

 tail -n +2 E.coli.fasta | wc -m


#5 to count the number of matches of 'ATGC' within the E. coli genome, we first remove the first line of the E.coli.fasta file, we then delete newline characters by using 'tr -d '\n'', where 'tr -d' specifies to delete '\n' which codes for newline characters. 'grep -o -ATGC E.coli.fasta' is used to pick out ATGC occurances from the E.coli.fasta file, 'grep' prints lines that matches specifed patterns, '-o' species that only matched parts can be printed, with each part printed on a separate output line. '-ATGC' specifies what line to match. 'wc -l' prints of the number lines of ATGC produced in the previous pipe.


 tail -n +2 E.coli.fasta | tr  -d ‘\n’ | grep  -o "ATGC" E.coli.fasta | wc -l  


#6 To compute the AT/GC ratio, we count the numbers of times both A and T occur in the E.coli.fasta file by pritning each time the they occur on a separate output by using 'grep -o "[A|T"]', where [A|T] specifies A and T match separately and are to be printed off separately; this number is then assigned to AT . 'wc -l' counts the number of lines (number of times both A and T occur in the file). this was then repeated for counting the number of times G and C both occured respectively, replacing [A|T] with [G|C] and AT with GC. The ratio of AT to GC was then calculated using 'echo "scale=5; $AT/$GC" | bc' where 'echo "scale=5; $AT/GC"' divides AT by GC and that the sum be displayed at 5 decimal places. 'bc' then runs that calculation.

AT=$(grep -o -i "[A|T]" E.coli.fasta | wc -l); GC=$(grep -o -i "[G|C]" E.coli.fasta | wc -l); echo "scale=5; $AT/$GC" | bc
